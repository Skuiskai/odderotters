Website for the FC. 

How to contribute:

Ask for permissions, please know how to use git before asking. Discord Imp#5482
 Email Skuiskaiofficial@gmail.com

Clone the files into the directory of your choice, you can always do this even without permissions, so if you want to view 
the website you can always download the files and open the index.html file with your browser. Be sure that all of the files 
that came in Odder_Otters directory are still in the same directory, they should be by default, but if you want to move them 
you have to move all of them. 

PRIORITIES RIGHT NOW

1. Create the home page.
2. Create the system of navigation on the website.
3. Create newsfeed for current events/create organized page where users can interact with news that should be interacted with.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions to ask ourselves: 

Should there be users?
Should people be able to login and have their own profile?

Goals

Create the homepage, the homepage should be a login page where people must login with username and password to access certain parts of the website. Things that you might not need a username and password for might include the gallery, things you do need a username and password for would include the news feed and any interaction with such news feed.

Setup a system of navigation between different parts of the website. Just need to setup the basic skeleton for how the navigation will work on the website.

Future goals

DESIGN, we need to get some art on the website
Custom logo, custom navigation bars and custom background are essential.
