FC website project
Website for the FC. 

PRIORITIES RIGHT NOW

1. Create the home page.
2. Create the system of navigation on the website.
3. Create newsfeed for current events/create organized page where users can interact with news that should be interacted with.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions to ask ourselves: 

Should there be users?
Should people be able to login and have their own profile?

Goals

Create the homepage, the homepage should be a login page where people must login with username and password to access certain parts of the website. Things that you might not need a username and password for might include the gallery, things you do need a username and password for would include the news feed and any interaction with such news feed.

Setup a system of navigation between different parts of the website. Just need to setup the basic skeleton for how the navigation will work on the website.

Future goals

DESIGN, we need to get some art on the website
Custome logo, custom navigation bars and custom background are essential.
